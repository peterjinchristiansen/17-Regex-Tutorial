# Regex Tutorial Starter Code

## Challenges

I am aware I did this assignment incorrectly. After I realized what the challenge actually was, I planned on skipping it in favor of the Redux challenge as it did not align with what I feel my strengths are. Due to a lack of time, I was unable to complete either.

My plan was to create a regular expression of a sample informal [written] speech, but as I planned further along I felt I wasn't creative enough to come up with examples of ways to incorporate the more advanced concepts.
